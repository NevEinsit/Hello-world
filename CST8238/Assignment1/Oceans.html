                    <p>The <b>Atlantic Ocean</b> is the second largest of the world's oceans, with an area of about 106,460,000 square kilometers (41,100,000
                      square miles). It covers approximately 20 percent of Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It
                      separates the "Old World" from the "New World".</p>
                    <p>The Atlantic Ocean occupies an elongated, S-shaped basin extending longitudinally between Europe and Africa to the east, and the
                      Americas to the west. As one component of the interconnected World Ocean, it is connected in the north to the Arctic Ocean, to
                      the Pacific Ocean in the southwest, the Indian Ocean in the southeast, and the Southern Ocean in the south (other definitions
                      describe the Atlantic as extending southward to Antarctica). The Equatorial Counter Current subdivides it into the <b>North(ern)
                      Atlantic Ocean</b> and the <b>South(ern) Atlantic Ocean</b> at about 8°N.
                    </p>
                    <p>Scientific explorations of the Atlantic include the Challenger expedition, the German Meteor expedition, Columbia University's
                      Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and the United States Navy Hydrographic Office.

                    <p>The <b>Pacific Ocean</b> is the largest and deepest of Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to
                      the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by the continents of Asia and
                      Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.</p>
                    <p>At 165,250,000 square kilometers (63,800,000 square miles) in area (as defined with an Antarctic southern border), this largest
                      division of the World Ocean—and, in turn, the hydrosphere—covers about 46% of Earth's water surface and about one-third of its
                      total surface area, making it larger than all of Earth's land area combined. The centers of both the Water Hemisphere and
                      the Western Hemisphere are in the Pacific Ocean. The equator subdivides it into the <b>North(ern) Pacific Ocean</b> and <b>South(ern)
                      Pacific Ocean</b>, with two exceptions: the Galápagos and Gilbert Islands, while straddling the equator, are deemed wholly within
                      the South Pacific.</p>
                    <p>Its mean depth is 4,000 meters (13,000 feet). Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench, located in the western north Pacific, is
                      the deepest point in the world, reaching a depth of 10,928 meters (35,853 feet). The Pacific also contains the deepest point
                      in the Southern Hemisphere, the Horizon Deep in the Tonga Trench, at 10,823 meters (35,509 feet). The third deepest point on
                      Earth, the Sirena Deep, is also located in the Mariana Trench.</p>
                    <p>The western Pacific has many major marginal seas, including the South China Sea, the East China Sea, the Sea of Japan, the
                      Sea of Okhotsk, the Philippine Sea, the Coral Sea, and the Tasman Sea.</p>

                    <p>The <b>Arctic Ocean</b> is the smallest and shallowest of the world's five major oceans. It is also known as the coldest of all
                      the oceans. The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) recognizes it as an ocean, although some oceanographers call
                      it the <b>Arctic Sea</b>. It is sometimes classified as an estuary of the Atlantic Ocean, and it is also seen as the northernmost
                      part of the all-encompassing World Ocean.</p>
                    <p>Located mostly in the Arctic north polar region in the middle of the Northern Hemisphere, besides its surrounding waters the
                      Arctic Ocean is surrounded by Eurasia and North America. It is partly covered by sea ice throughout the year and almost completely
                      in winter. The Arctic Ocean's surface temperature and salinity vary seasonally as the ice cover melts and freezes; its salinity
                      is the lowest on average of the five major oceans, due to low evaporation, heavy fresh water inflow from rivers and streams, and
                      limited connection and outflow to surrounding oceanic waters with higher salinities. The summer shrinking of the ice has been
                      quoted at 50%. The US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) uses satellite data to provide a daily record of Arctic sea                  ice cover and the rate of melting compared to an average period and specific past years.</p>
