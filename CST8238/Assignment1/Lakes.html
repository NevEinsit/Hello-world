              <h2>Lakes<sup>*</sup></h2>
              <p>Canada has an extremely large number of lakes, with the number of lakes larger than three square kilometres being
                estimated at close to 31,752 by the Atlas of Canada. Of these, 561 lakes have a surface area larger than 100 km<sup>2</sup>,
                including four of the Great Lakes. Almost 9% (891,163 square kilometres (344,080 sq mi)) of Canada's total area is covered
                by freshwater. There is no official estimate of the number of smaller lakes.</p>
              <p>In this page I will just list a very few number of lakes. However, they are still attractive as well.</p>

                        <h4>Lake Louise<sup>[1]</sup></h4>
                        <p>Considered by many to be the crown jewel of Banff National Park, Lake Louise is nearly impossible to describe without resorting
                          to shameless cliches. Standing next to the serene, implausibly turquoise lake, Banff's wild grandeur feels (and is) tantalizingly
                          close, with a surrounding amphitheater of finely chiseled mountains that hoist Victoria Glacier audaciously toward the heavens.</p>
                        <p>Famous for its teahouses, grizzly bears and hiking trails, Lake Louise is also renowned for its much-commented-on 'crowds,'
                          plus the incongruous lump of towering concrete known as Chateau Lake Louise. But, frankly, who cares? You don't come to Lake
                          Louise to dodge other tourists. You come to share in one of the Rockies' most spectacular sights, one that has captured the
                          imaginations of mountaineers, artists and visitors for more than a century.</p>
                        <p>Lake Louise 'village,' just off Trans-Canada Hwy/Hwy 1, is little more than an outdoor shopping mall, a gas station and a handful
                          of hotels.</p>

                        <h4>Abraham Lake<sup>[2]</sup></h4>
                        <p>Lake Abraham looks similar to other glacial lakes in the Rocky Mountains, with its striking milky blue waters (the result
                          of rock flour, a fine silt carried down from nearby glaciers) and surrounding snow-tipped peaks. But Lake Abraham isn’t
                          natural.</p>
                        <p>The lake, which is now Alberta’s largest reservoir, was created in 1972 with the construction of the Bighorn Dam on the
                          North Saskatchewan River. It was named after Silas Abraham, who lived in the North Saskatchewan River valley in the late
                          1800s and guided early explorers in the region.</p>
                        <p>But Lake Abraham’s real claim to fame isn’t one most humans would be proud of: It’s got a bad case of gas. Methane, to
                          be precise.</p>
                        <p>Methane bubbles form in bodies of water when dead organic matter falls into the water and sinks to the bottom. Bacteria
                          feed on the organic matter, such as leaves and dead animals, releasing methane gas. This is particularly pronounced in an
                          artificial lake like Lake Abraham, whose lake bed was already covered with vegetation.</p>
                        <p>Bacteria pooping out methane may not sound like the start of something beautiful, but in Lake Abraham’s case, the
                          phenomenon has created something outdoor enthusiasts and photographers come to see every winter.</p>
                        <p>As ice forms on the lake, the methane bubbles rising up from the lake bed become frozen in the ice at different levels.
                          This creates stacks of frozen bubbles, held in suspended animation. On a bright day with no snow on the ice, the bubbles
                          are clear to see, along with other patterns formed in the ice.</p>

                        <p>Berg Lake is a lake on the Robson River just below the river's source located within Mount Robson Provincial Park, at
                          the doorstep of the north face of Mount Robson, the highest peak in the Canadian Rockies. It is partly fed by the Berg

                        <p>The turquoise colored Berg Lake is dotted with icebergs even in the middle of summer. Berg Lake can be reached by
                          following a marked hiking trail for 19 kilometres (12 mi) from the parking lot. To reach the parking lot, follow
                          Highway 5 north from Valemount to Highway 16 and head east 18 kilometres (11 mi). Or, follow Yellowhead Highway
                          16 west from Jasper townsite for 84 kilometres (52 mi) to the Mount Robson Viewpoint centre. On the north side of
                          the highway, follow a two-lane paved road for 2 kilometres (1.2 mi), ending at the parking lot.</p>

                        <p>Lake Superior, the largest of the Great Lakes of North America, is also the world's largest freshwater lake by surface area,
                          and the third largest freshwater lake by volume. It is shared by the Canadian province of Ontario to the north, the U.S. state
                          of Minnesota to the west, and Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan to the south. The farthest north and west of
                          the Great Lakes chain, Superior has the highest elevation of all five great lakes and drains into the St. Mary's River.</p>
                        <p>Lake Superior empties into Lake Huron via the St. Marys River and the Soo Locks. Lake Superior is the largest freshwater
                          lake in the world in area and the third largest in volume, behind Lake Baikal in Siberia and Lake Tanganyika in East Africa.
                          The Caspian Sea, while larger than Lake Superior in both surface area and volume, is brackish; though presently isolated,
                          prehistorically the Caspian has been repeatedly connected to and then isolated from the Mediterranean via the Black Sea.</p>
                        <p>The largest island in Lake Superior is Isle Royale in the state of Michigan. Isle Royale contains several lakes, some of
                          which also contain islands. Other well-known islands include Madeline Island in the state of Wisconsin, Michipicoten Island
                          in the province of Ontario, and Grand Island (the location of the Grand Island National Recreation Area) in the state of
                          Michigan.</p>

                        <p>Emerald Lake is located in Yoho National Park, British Columbia, Canada. It is the largest of Yoho's 61 lakes and ponds, as
                          well as one of the park's premier tourist attractions. Emerald Lake Lodge, a high-end lodge perched on the edge of the lake,
                          provides local accommodation. A 5.2 km (3.2 mi) hiking trail circuits the lake, the first half of which is accessible to
                          wheelchairs and strollers. During the summer months, canoe rentals are available; in the winter, the lake is a popular cross
                          country skiing destination.</p>

                          <br>
                        <p>The lake is enclosed by mountains of the President Range, as well as Mount Burgess and Wapta Mountain. This basin traps storms,
                          causing frequent rain in summer and heavy snowfalls in winter. This influx of moisture works with the lake's low elevation to
                          produce a unique selection of flora. Trees found here are more typical of B.C.'s wet interior forests, such as western red cedar,
                          western yew, western hemlock and western white pine. The alluvial fan on the northeast shore produces wildflowers in abundance
                          during late June and early July.</p>
                        <p>Due to its high altitude, the lake is frozen from November until June. The vivid turquoise color of the water, caused by powdered
                          limestone, is most spectacular in July as the snow melts from the surrounding mountains.</p>
                        <p>The first non-indigenous person to set sight on Emerald Lake was Canadian guide Tom Wilson, who stumbled upon it by accident in
                          1882. A string of his horses had gotten away, and it was while tracking them that he first entered the valley. The lake had an
                          impression on even the most seasoned of explorers: "For a few moments I sat [on] my horse and enjoyed the rare, peaceful beauty
                          of the scene." It was Wilson who gave the lake its name because of its remarkable colour, caused by fine particles of glacial
                          sediment, also referred to as rock flour, suspended in the water. However, this was not the first time Wilson had dubbed a lake
                          'Emerald'. Earlier that same year he had discovered another lake which he had given the same moniker, and the name even appeared
                          briefly on the official map. This first lake however, was shortly renamed Lake Louise.</p>
